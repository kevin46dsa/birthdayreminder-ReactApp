# birthdayreminder-ReactApp

Forgot your Bestfirends Birthday?? and now you have to plan a whole suprise party just to cover that up ?

Introducing Birthday Reminder, Gone are the days where Meta(Facebook) reminded us of our friends birthdays.

## Features

### Simplicity
the real moto behind the app is simplicity, the user will be given a unique account once he is signed up and all the user has to do is add the birthdays he wants to be reminded of and thats it !! its that simple !! 
the user never has to worry about anything again, the reasoning to this point ties into our next core feature

### Mail
As busy as we get there is always one thing that takes top priority, "Email"
Emails are the only way of communication in a professional environment and what better way to be reminded of your friends birthday than an email.
the email contains a list of friends/family that have their birthday on that day and the next day so that your always on top of your birthday wishes game
dont worry about SPAM !! we all hate spam, the api server makes sure that a mail is sent out only if the user has a friends birthday on the current day or the followinf day.

### Security
the web page offers Secure Login and Sign up that is created using JWT tokens, which is checked at every server request so that you know that your data is safe. the Password is also Hashed using Bycrypt for additional security.

### Web Page
As you can see this is created using REACT, so obviouly we have a web front for this project, that the user can interact with the dashboard add or remove data (Birthdays the user wants to be reminded about). the dash board also displays the same data as the mail where it shows the birthdays today and the following day
